# Space-Engineers-Inverntory-Management-Script
This script helps manage grid inventories for space engineers. Allows smooth transfer of resources enabling you to have multiple refineries.

## Installing The Script:
To use this script add the "Moving Raw Resources To Refinarys.cs" file into your game scripts for **Space Engineers**.

## How to use:
- For the grid you place your programming block on:
  1. Make sure all the conveyor belts are connected with each Cargo Container and Refinery.
  2. (optional) Attach a LCD Text Panel to your grid and name it "Resource Monitor" to see what resources you have in your grid.
